####Overview

Our scenario for creating such an application is that the marketing group could benefit from a web application to make revenue predictions based on the linear regression model. Some topics utilized by this app are:

 - creating a `ui.R` and `server.R` file
 - creating a `sliderInput` widget
 - rendering a plot within a Shiny app using `renderPlot({})`
 - using **reactivity** and **variable scoping**

####Installing Required Packages

This Shiny app requires 1 package:

1. `install.packages(c('shiny'))`

####Running the App Locally

There are 2 ways to run the app:

- Running directly from Github:
	
	`shiny::runGitHub(repo = 'com.packtpub.intro.r.bi',
	                 username = 'jgendron', 
	   				 subdir = 'Chapter8-ShinyDashboards/expenditures-revenue-app/')`
