#Optimizing Service Truck Routes
*Chapter 7 Data Visualization*

-------

An R script that calculates the optimal path between bike kiosk locations.

####Overview

Our scenario for creating this solution is that the logistics team at Bike Sharing, LLC. needed to find the optimal path between bike kiosk locations for a maintenance truck to travel. The ideal solution would reduce fuel and manhours spent while maintaining the fleet of bikes all across the city.

What is the purpose of this script?

What does the script do?

How does it do it? (what do the two functions do, attributions if taken from elsewhere?)

What is the final result?

Why has this solved the problem?

####Installing Required Packages

This script requires 2 packages to be installed:

1. `install.packages(c('TSP', 'Imap))`
